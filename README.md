Project Title: Chocka's Web Portfolio
Video Demo: https://youtu.be/ZK0PD9TgbyU
Description: The Portfolio Web is a dynamic platform designed to showcase my academic achievements, professional experiences, and research projects in the field of mathematics. With interactive tools such as prime number calculators and a seamless navigation system, this web portfolio offers a comprehensive overview of my academic journey and accomplishments.

Main Features:
1. Homepage (index.html):
The homepage serves as the central hub of the Portfolio Web, welcoming visitors with a vibrant Canva banner adorned with intricate mathematical concepts. A cartoonified representation of myself, alongside my name and title as a student of mathematics, sets the tone for the exploration of my academic prowess. This page acts as an inviting gateway, featuring links to various sections of the portfolio and providing easy access to relevant information.

2. Achievements (achievements.html):
In this section, I meticulously list all my awards and honors, accompanied by concise descriptions elucidating the significance of each accolade. Utilizing a simple list format allows for effortless additions or removals of items, ensuring that only the most relevant achievements are highlighted to prospective employers or admission officers.

3. Experiences (experiences.html):
Similar to the achievements section, the experiences page presents a comprehensive overview of my professional journey, showcasing relevant job experiences and responsibilities. By employing a user-friendly list format, I can seamlessly update this section to reflect my latest endeavors, catering to the specific requirements of potential employers or educational institutions.

4. Projects (projects.html):
Instead of merely showcasing my C codes and mathematical research projects, I have integrated interactive calculator programs that allow visitors to explore the practical applications of my work. From the "Exemption Rule," a groundbreaking sieving technique for prime number identification, to the Goldbach's Conjecture calculator, this section provides an immersive experience, enabling users to interact with my projects firsthand.

5. Research Papers (research-papers.html):
Here, I provide brief insights into my published mathematical works available on Academia.edu. Each research paper is accompanied by a succinct summary, offering visitors a glimpse into the depth and breadth of my scholarly contributions. Quick links to the respective papers on Academia.edu facilitate easy access for those interested in exploring my research further.

6. Links (links.html):
To foster connectivity and facilitate networking opportunities, I have curated a collection of links to my professional profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn and Academia.edu. Additionally, visitors can find my email address for direct communication or to follow my latest endeavors.

Additional Components:
- Navbar.js:
The navigation bar, implemented using JavaScript, ensures smooth navigation throughout the Portfolio Web. Its intuitive design and functionality enhance the user experience, allowing visitors to seamlessly explore different sections of the website with ease.

- CSS Styling:
To imbue the Portfolio Web with a distinctive aesthetic, I have incorporated AI-generated artwork inspired by my physical characteristics and passion for mathematics and technology. The CSS file features intricate design elements, including blurring effects that enhance visual appeal without compromising readability.
