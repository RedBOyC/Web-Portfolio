                <h3>Retail Assistant at NTUC FairPrice</h3>
                <p>
                    From October 2018 - January 2019 and from November 2019 - February 2020, I worked part-time as a retail assistant at FairPrice.
                    As a retail assistant, I helped stock shelves with new products, arranged the new batch in the storeroom, decorated the store during holiday seasons,
                    and assisted customers in finding products and explaining how they work.

                <p>
                    After completing my Secondary school education, I worked as a tutor, providing exam tips and tricks, summarizing contents, and assisting with assignments.
                    I reached out to students via social media platforms such as Telegram and Reddit, offering help for free. Currently, I am volunteering as a tutor at Epsworth Learning Center.

                <h3>Staff Assistant at Woodlands Division, Singapore Police Force</h3>
                <p>
                    During my National Service, I was given the role of Staff Assistant to Head Service Quality at Woodlands Service Quality Branch for Woodlands Police Division.
                    As part of my job, I took note of feedback, stored them in a database, used spreadsheets to design charts and presented them in PowerPoint.
                    I was deployed for the 2023 presidential election and 2023 F1 Grand Prix to conduct Unit Morale Sensing, assessing the morale level of officers deployed on the grounds,
                    and suggesting improvements to their welfare and well-being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of my responsibilities, I observed the professionalism of SPF officers and responded to the needs of the members of the public.
                    I collaborated with other agencies such as the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Education, Town Council, and Members of Parliament to resolve community problems and promote a harmonious society.
                    I was also in charge of three understudies, leading them through good and professional work examples and taking care of their well-being as a leader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the basic officer course, I achieved the highest score in police law studies.
