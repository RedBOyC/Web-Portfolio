Project Title: Chocka's Web Portfolio
Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FcYbB6mDhc
Description: A website created to showcase my various work experiences, achievements and the projects I have worked on. At the end there is a links section to connect with me on various other platforms like LinkedIn and Academia.edu. I have used custom made banners and background images using tools like Canva, Cartoonify and AI art generators to capture me as a person. For instance. my banner is made of mathematical concepts which shows readers that I have strong interest in mathematics, and am a student of mathematics at my local university. I used a cyber futuristic background of an animated version of me in the CSS and used blurring effect to make my background more lively without it interfering with my texts. I used javascript to write the the navigation bar as it was easier, and only required on code file which can be linked in my other html files to display the navigation bar at the top of the webpage, and a return to homepage link at the bottom of each html if users would like a quick return to the homepage. I also wrote a more interactive version of my research papers by making them a calculator so that users can play round with my mathematical technique insted of just reading plain texts, but if they are interested, there is a quick link to each of my papers on Academia.edu.
