                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Mathematics is like a thrilling adventure for me, especially when I explore topics like numbers, secret codes, and how math connects to computers and the universe.</p>
                <p>I love solving puzzles and asking questions that make people think differently.</p>
                <p>Right now, I'm studying Math at the National University of Singapore (NUS). But before that, I've done all sorts of jobs like working in a store and helping with office stuff.</p>
                <p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy helping out in my community. I started volunteering in school, and now I still do it in my free time.</p>
                <p>When I'm not busy with all that, I like to tackle tough math problems and take part in competitions.</p>
                <p>Overall, I'm just a curious person who loves learning and helping out where I can.</p>
